**Quick.db** is installed by default with some example helper methods defined in `structures/Guild.js` & `structures/GuildMember.js`. If you would like to change it out with anotherdatabase, it is easy to do so.

More information on discord-akairo's database handling can be found [here](https://discord-akairo.github.io/#/docs/main/8.0.0/other/providers).

Create a `.env` file & place your token under a property titled 'TOKEN' to run.
