You can create new methods to extend the current strucutres...

Example:
Check Role.js, here you can see the following:

get memberCount() {
   return this.members.size;
}

This means that all roles now have the .memberCount property. <Role>.memberCount
Additionally, you can check Client.js for an extension method:

capitalizeFirstLetter(string) {
    return string.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + string.slice(1);
}

This means that when you access <Client> it'll have that method.
This can be accessed using this.client.<Method> in commands.
